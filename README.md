# MysticMind.HtmlAgilityPack

This is a port of the popular [HtmlAgilityPack](https://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/) targetting the .Net core 1.0 RTM. This fork points to v1.4.9.4 of the actual source including namespaces. 

This is an agile HTML parser that builds a read/write DOM and supports plain XPATH or XSLT (you actually don't HAVE to understand XPATH nor XSLT to use it, don't worry...). It is a .NET code library that allows you to parse "out of the web" HTML files. The parser is very tolerant with "real world" malformed HTML. The object model is very similar to what proposes System.Xml, but for HTML documents (or streams). 

Note: Since there is no official library from [HtmlAgilityPack](https://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/) targeting .Net core so far, using this as a reliable source for our projects including OSS ones which uses HtmlAgilityPack. We will aim to maintain this until the official ones are released. Feel free to use it in your projects.
